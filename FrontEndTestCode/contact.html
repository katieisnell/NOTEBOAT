          <p> Shoud you find yourself asking question like I do at night. You can contact us via electronic mail. By "us", I mean Katie Snell the secretary. Her electronic mail address is katie.snell@student.manchester.ac.uk</p>
          
          <p>Before you do that though, here is a couple of frequantly asked questions. What is the meaning of life? How much wood would a woodpeck peck if a woodpeck could peck wood? How can one refrain from procrastiinating whilst attaining their degree in Computer Science and Maths in the UoM?</p> 
          
          <p>You may have noticed I have not endeavoured to answer these questions but rather I would like YOU to answer them for me. Katie Snell would be very pleased to receive your electronical letters containing answers to these questions. Of course, If you have actual serious questions you can also ask Katie.</p> 
            
          <p>Our office is situated in Kilburn Collab 1 or 2. I forget, but it should not be rather hard to find us. In this case, "us" refers to the names mentioned in the about page. If you see some people, one or more of them may be us. Should zero persons be in the room then there is zero possibility that we are there, according to Lemma 10.1, which states that if there are no persons in one room then there are no persons in that room.  </p>
