General overview
	-Timetable originally displays as being from 9am to 9pm (but is scrollable)

	-User will be able to edit anything if they wish (so if they want to skip ((((((but really incase we integrate their official classes wrong)))))) 
	-Login with their student email (and password???)
	-Include deadlines, deadline alerts?


Possible implementation?

	-Where are storing blank questionnaire?
	-How are we storing their responses to questionnaire?


Questions to ask student initially
Questions which give us info we need to “manipulate”:
	-How confident do you feel on each module: COMP10120, MATH10131 etc. on scale 0 to 5 (0 = I don't understand anything, 5 = I understand everything)
		->In lectures
		->Coursework/labwork
		->Homework
		->Exam revision
	-Do you prefer focusing on one subject at a time or various subjects? (one subject or many)

Questions which gives us pure information (i.e. we don’t need to manipulate):
	-Which year and semester are you currently in? (year and semester)
	-When do you study best (time of the day)?
	-Do you work better at home/library/<<INSERT BUILDING PREFERENCE>>?
		->Coursework/labwork
		->Homework
		->Exam revision
	-How long does it take you to get to uni? (minutes)
	-Do you like studying before university? (yes/no) 
	-Do you have a job? (yes/no)
		->What times do you work? (enter different times of different days)
	-How long can you study for in one period? (time which is multiple of 5mins)
	-How long are your study breaks? (time which is multiple of 5mins)


Questions to ask regularly (using popups):
